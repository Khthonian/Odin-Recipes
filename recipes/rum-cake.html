    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indulge in this grown-up chocolate cake laced with dark rum and raisins. Eat straightaway or feed with 1-2 tbsp rum weekly and store in an airtight container.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>225g soft margarine, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>200g raisins</li>
        <li>235ml dark rum, plus extra for feeding (optional)</li>
        <li>180g dark brown soft sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>125g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>100g cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub margarine around the inside of an 8-inch round springform cake tin and line with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Tip the raisins and rum into a blender and blitz to create a thick paste (there will be a few lumps).</li>
        <li>Beat the 225g margarine and sugar together in a separate bowl using a whisk or electric whisk until pale and fluffy, then add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Don’t worry if the mixture splits – it will eventually come together.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour and cocoa, and mix using a spatula until just combined. Mix in the rum and raisin paste.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 35 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. If wet batter still clings to the skewer, bake for a further 10 mins, covering with foil if the cake has browned too much. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 mins before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. <em>The cake can be served straightaway or fed with 1-2 tbsp rum weekly, wrapped well and stored in an airtight container for up to a month.</em></li>
    </ol>
