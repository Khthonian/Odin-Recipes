    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Use our easy gluten-free bread recipe to make light, fluffy breads which can be used for scooping up sauces, served alongside curries or served as a lunchtime snack with some dips.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g gluten-free self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting (we used Doves)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted</li>
        <li>300ml natural yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the grill to medium and dust a baking sheet with a little flour. Mix the flour and cumin seeds in a bowl, then season. Stir in the yogurt and 100ml water, then mix well to form a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, then shape into circles or ovals about Â½cm thick. Dust lightly with a little flour. Grill on the baking sheet for 3-5 mins on each side until golden and puffed. Serve warm.</li>
